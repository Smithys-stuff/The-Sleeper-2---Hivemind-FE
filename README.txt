This is the rerelease of my mod know as "The sleeper - Fallen Hive Empire" for stellaris.
Feel fre to make suggestions.



This is also where I keep my notes, ideas for the mod and other things. Don't expect anything based on what I wrote here.

to do
- icon for feeder vassal
- unable to use colossi on dormant sleeper as of right now.
- add events to keep AI empires from attacking/ making them attack with reason. maybe just keep them from attacking the last two borderplanets? maybe lock it all together when outside of a war (during war they can use the systems for travel) and handle it all through events (chances based on ethics, etc,)? AI should never enter the sleepers terretory. Taking over a borderplanet should be handled by events, which are rolled at the end of every year for all its direct neighbors. Chance depends on fleetpower, current wars, warplans?, ethics and resolutions.
- recreate patches


Long term ideas:

- add a pacifist FE as the sleepers rival. They only own one system which is heavily guarded. It has a single planet in it, which has the species decendants on it that have regressed to a primitive way of live.
	-upon entering, the guardians will explain that they want to persue the natural evolution of their species in peace and found that hiding is the best way to do that.
	-one of the sleepers systems contains a portal, which is linked to another system without any hyperlanes. Can be accessed through a speciel project.
	- The maintain a strong policy of isolationism and persue a "natural evolution", but they see the sleeper and endgamecrisis as external influences big enough to awaken  
	- should the berseking sleeper become too big, they will gift the sleepers neighbors fleets to deal with it
	- in case of a real awakening, they will react as soon as a country is subjegated by the sleeper. They will try to form a federation with fellow FEs and willing lesser races or join a federation if it is big enough.
	-should the sleeper get to big, they will see that as a threat to their project and awaken to fight it. The portal will be blown up (perp unknown) and two reuined ones will be restored (they are spawned wit the beginning of the game). They will use the portal networks of other empires to fight the sleeper

- border planets: turn a planet into a primitive hivmind the player can study for researchpoints and a special damage mod against the sleeper instead?
- new graphical culture?
-arcane deciphering: get the ability to build one of their buildings from their artifacts if you are a hive.
-add more pictures to the events
-chance to spawn with a modified tree of life origin
- when the berserker awakes, neighboring devouering swarms may the option to help the sleeper. they will have to declare war on every neighbor of the sleeper. They will however stay at war after the sleeper has been defeated.
- readd deviance mechanic but with less randomness?
